# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to compare and contrast the difference in reviews for Vine users and non Vine users to find a different perception of products depending on the user type. For this analysis we looked at the data for Video Games.

## Results

- The total number of reviews were 94 for vine and 40,471 for non-vine users
- There were 48 number of 5-star reviews for Vine users, and 15,663 for non-Vine users
- % of those review show that 51% of Vine reviews were 5-stars compared to only 38% for non-Vine users.

## Summary
It does seem to be that Vine users tend to give more 5-star reviews which could be bias influenced.
One additional Analysis I would perform would be to make a distrubution graph displaying the reviews to show the avgerage review.
Additionally, I would do a sentiment analysis on the wording of the reviews itself to see if reviews are written differently compared to the 2 user types.
